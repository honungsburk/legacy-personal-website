        <div class="excerpt">
        <p>I’ll make this short. For the past few months I’ve been reading up on the world of crypto. I’m talking blockchain, DID:s, trust of IP, crypto currencies, smart contracts, IPFS - the whole shebang. There are a lot of get rich quick schemes, pumps &amp; dumps and the like but if step away from that there is a deep ideological motivation behind the movement. The idea that a lot of the government and other large forms of institutions can be improved, even replaced. That they can be more democratic. More fair. Guaranteeing every citizen on earth the inalienable rights of freedom of expression and commerce (and maybe even more).</p>

        <div class="excerpt">
        <p>No matter where you turn there is a cry for objectivity. To analyse and report on some subject in neutral way which accurately portraits the different opinions, counter opinions, and of course counter counter opinions. I’ve myself searched far and wide, enjoying detailed documentaries, podcasts and books; Watched reviews, and read articles; Once I even delved in to the depths of a comment section, thankfully reemerged whole. But no - the best I’ve ever have come across was nuanced, not objective.</p>

        <p>When ever we talk about the big tech companies we make the sound invincible. Like we have forgotten that once IBM looked just as dominant. Mosaic and Myspace where followed by Internet Explorer (Microsoft) and Facebook. Yahoo thought search was irrelevant, a grave mistake it turned out. And of course Microsoft, with an almost complete lock on the consumer pc market, never got a hold in the smart phone space. Nothing lasts forever. Especially in tech.</p>

        <div class="excerpt">
        <p>When you do something that takes a lot of effort one has to have momentum. Because when you loose it, it is really hard to get the ball back rolling again. I’ve numerous dead git repos where I tinkered but never got a working prototype loosing all interest when progress grinded to a halt. And this is true for more things then just code. I’ve tried writing short stories and posed the exact same problem: I just couldn’t finnish them before getting bored.</p>

        <p>That tattoos hurt is perhaps no surprise to you, and it wasn’t to me either. But I had no idea what I was getting myself into. You see, this past half-year I’ve had a sleeve done on my left arm and if I had known I’m not sure I would have gone through with it. That does not mean that I regret it. In fact I do not. But it does mean I’m a bit of a wimp.</p>

        <p>In my second year of university I decided I needed a new hobby. I’d tried writing but the times I could sit down and get into the flow were few and far in between. You probably know the feeling. Your past self (always that damn past self) has promised you’ll do something but when you get to it you find out your not that stoked anymore (and he can go screw himself). But you sit down, maybe in front of your computer but better would be if you’d just grab a piece of paper. Where did I put the paper again? Anyway, if you’re lucky, you get on with it. But I wasn’t getting lucky often so on whim I started painting. No particular goal in mind but I thought to myself: “man, wouldn’t it be cool if I ever do a portrait?” And you know what? I liked.</p>

        <p>During Easter I finally found some time to finish my website: fix the styling, html templates, and all the rest. But during my “involuntary” break of little more over a year I found myself scratching me head looking through my Jekyll project. <em>Oh my…</em> I thought to myself. And seeing as I’ve been toying around with Haskell I promptly decided to rebuild the entire thing using Hakyll instead. Brilliant.</p>
