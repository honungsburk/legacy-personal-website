This site was built using Hakyll, a haskell static site generator, and is my own personal website where I write blog posts and show of things that interests me.
You'll find a link to the public github repo down bellow.
Feel free to use it in any way you see fit.

p.s. A cheap way to host your own site is by using github pages. You can read more [here](https://pages.github.com/).
