As early dawn spreads her palm and folly takes its grasp,  
    Heed her call and take my arm for sorrow will not pass.  
The heart will beat in steady streams of tearful memories.  
    How blissful nights of innocence turn to haunting dreams.  
Every sight and every pain we grieve but dare not paint;  
    So nigh and so sly is the truth we dare not face.  
Instead weâ€™ll hide in between the wings of liberty,  
    And among its feathers find our peace in blissful misery.
