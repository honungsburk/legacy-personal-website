  <p>I had not cleared my path — been dwarfed — I fell<br />
through a crack, my eyes watered from the speed<br />
of the wind that blew past me, as I entered hell.<br />
I was measured, weighted, and told to cry my plead<br />
because it would be deep and know no end.<br />
I’d spilled sober thoughts to the wrong friend.</p>
<p>I searched the hall for a dead man’s boots.<br />
“Lucky as always”, my stoned self stammered.<br />
My bones and yaw were tangled in roots,<br />
for one of nature’s spirits had got me hammered<br />
and soon it all would vanish — the miracle die —<br />
and another brave cosmonaut be stuck in the sky.</p>
<p>There was still fuel with which to tease his guest<br />
chained between the best and the better world<br />
in the state of fixed but not possessed.<br />
Its potential crumbled as his head was whirled<br />
from a stumble across the creases — hard pressed —<br />
to scared to let my comfort be undressed.</p>
<p>Are you not the famed cosmic dancer?<br />
Visiting yourself on your ‘tour de Chambre’.<br />
A bright light that holds no answer<br />
but themes were the subjects drown in rum.<br />
Answering every question with the whirling words:<br />
“We live in the best of all possible worlds!”</p>
<p>By the river young men were skipping rocks<br />
inviting me to join their fine pastime<br />
and seeing as passion is but a black box<br />
perhaps a skip and plunge could restore my prime,<br />
taking me on top the hill that kept me blind,<br />
and let me view the orchards of my mind.</p>
<p>Describe yourself — naked — in the flesh<br />
pulling your mind through the thick of herbs,<br />
letting your image crack, exposed afresh,<br />
and hear yourself spill the words<br />
you’ve kept so close though they hurt,<br />
telling truth in a fictitious flirt.</p>
<p>Perhaps your kink is to be dressed down,<br />
to fell it raw on raw — love without bounds.<br />
Pacing your moans as it eclipses your crown,<br />
and peaks as you sip the wine made from the sound<br />
of silence. Where nothing is covered up,<br />
and one drop gives way to the entire cup.</p>
<p>You demon — angel — with claws and fangs,<br />
strokes of danger, and crimson flair,<br />
endangered beast, hunted by gangs<br />
of wealthy thieves with silver hair.<br />
Tell me, why do you love me so?<br />
There is nothing I won’t let you know.</p>
<p>Once sober, I contemplated my pledge.<br />
The young men urging me to dissolve<br />
my rough life full of edges,<br />
throw away my duties, abdicate and evolve<br />
my state of being, from a lifeless essence<br />
to an immutable immortal adolescence.</p>
<p>Everything was left spinning<br />
from when I pulled the safety pin.<br />
The explosion left my ears ringing.<br />
Is this what it means to win?<br />
To be covered in feathers and tar,<br />
thinking yourself a wandering star.</p>
