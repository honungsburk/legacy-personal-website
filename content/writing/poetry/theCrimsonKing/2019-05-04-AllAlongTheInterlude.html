  <p>Through mist, the rider came damp in heavy clothes.<br />
“Is this the way?”, he asked,<br />
for he wasn’t sure.<br />
“Depends,” said the gentleman.<br />
“Of course,” the charlatan.<br />
“Never,” spoke the crow.<br />
They all died in laughter, the prelude<br />
to the tale all along the interlude.</p>
<p>He mounted his bike that bleak morning<br />
when wind scuffled the leaves<br />
and rode the trees.<br />
When the levee breaks we’ll have no place.<br />
Can you hear the caw over wind and wave,<br />
awakening their deepest, most inner rage:<br />
crying floods, a burning temper. How rude —<br />
to flush us down all along the interlude.</p>
<p>The alleys crawled with sickening thoughts<br />
passing them by under flickering lights.<br />
“Thanks for tonight,”<br />
said as their hands unlocked<br />
and their (final?) eclipse was broken off.<br />
The spectacle — caught in the wrong view,<br />
by one who watch, one who pursue:<br />
eternal figures all along the interlude.</p>
<p>The past will change, blow by blow,<br />
until there is no more shelter from the storm;<br />
Where people come and go<br />
talking about comics and games for adults,<br />
the horrors of children’s toys.<br />
Letting the crow sing over wind and wave,<br />
while watchmen keep their view<br />
on the borders all along the interlude.</p>
<p>Is this his thrill? The beg, the moan.<br />
“The night doesn’t need to end here.”<br />
Hesitations unknown.<br />
And their glowing black was pulled together,<br />
by a night that seemed to last forever;<br />
A spectacle that sure looked like a crime<br />
from a distant watch in a tilted mood,<br />
like another forced entry all along the interlude.</p>
<p>Smoke curled around them. A demon? A wit?<br />
No, a hypocrite refusing to play tricks.<br />
For he was war,<br />
madness in a suit. Throwing himself at headlines,<br />
cashing in on past renown, bigger and better<br />
then any other star committing crimes,<br />
and speaks the truth — the right-wing renewed;<br />
“think of the children” all along the interlude.</p>
<p>The gentleman was the third seal that broke<br />
as he swooned and dined with mad men,<br />
lucky strikes with golden pens.<br />
“Friend, there is a lot to be gained!”<br />
Radiating blissful intent,<br />
leaving a fat tip and calling it a day,<br />
while one peddles poison to the prude and crude<br />
chanting “I broke no law!” all along the interlude.</p>
<p>— The Sirens’ Tune —<br />
The masked man strikes again!<br />
— Two scared to death<br />
Sunday morning a vigilante saved the day,<br />
or so he thought, before he was chased away<br />
by a man-made hurricane, a distraction for the crow.<br />
Please call the police if you have any clue<br />
why war rides all along the interlude.</p>
<p>The fourth had been there biding his time,<br />
day by day, the routine of your life.<br />
“A most trusted advisor.”<br />
Who you must call at once.<br />
For you find yourself amidst the worst of floods,<br />
and fear needs no more than a spark to turn hot,<br />
so you watch as the Empire subdue:<br />
“You rebel scum!” all along the interlude.</p>
<p>“My office, now!” demanded the sweaty man,<br />
the puppet in control whose flick of a switch<br />
could burn a world.<br />
While a watchman pulled off the greatest heist<br />
by staging Armageddon for the ultimate prize:<br />
to pass the day of our extinction.<br />
So let us raise a glass of crimson to our fortitude<br />
against the waves all along the interlude.</p>
<p>Bobcats growled just like the wind,<br />
while a dying fender cried out its sin.<br />
“Yes”, they swore,<br />
the gentleman, charlatan, and the crow.<br />
For no more chaos to be brought,<br />
that they leave this world, its perfect storm,<br />
while the forth was left to reap his due<br />
to judge each soul all along the interlude.</p>
