When ever we talk about the big tech companies we make the sound invincible.
Like we have forgotten that once IBM looked just as dominant.
Mosaic and Myspace where followed by Internet Explorer (Microsoft) and Facebook.
Yahoo thought search was irrelevant, a grave mistake it turned out.
And of course Microsoft, with an almost complete lock on the consumer pc market, never got a hold in the smart phone space.
Nothing lasts forever. Especially in tech.

While being the incumbent has some serious advantages, with deep pockets you can keep almost any upstart at bay, both Google and Facebook make their money off ads. 
A fact which turns out to have some serious drawbacks, increasing the spread of clickbait and fake news.
And with their lips around the crack pipe neither Facebook nor Google will ever let go of that sweet high known as "cash cash money".
So the one thing they can't do, even though they have all the talent and money in the world, is to create a new way of interaction on the web.
New ways of sharing content and getting paid.
New ways where the users don't need to give up their personal information.
New ways where we cut out the rent seekers.

If these things sound exciting to you, check out the Brave, DuckDuckGo, and Cardano.
The future is decentralized.
