Today I got myself embroiled in a internet discussion on whether or not it is okay for people to skip the vaccination.
And I'm now so riled up I have to write something down and (hopefully) avoid loosing any sleep over it.

If you can get vaccinated, if it is safe, then it is imperative that you do. 
Why? Because the percentage of the population that has to be vaccinated is quite high 
and varies depending on the disease (95% for measles while polio only need 80%). [[1]](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/herd-immunity-lockdowns-and-covid-19#:~:text=The%20percentage%20of%20people%20who,immunity%20is%20not%20known.)
Of course no one knows what the percentage will be for Covid-19.

But one thing is clear: if you don't take the vaccine other people will have to take it in your place. 
Why do you get to skip while we have to take it?

Of course, the reason people usually cite for not taking the vaccine is their fear over any potential side effects.
But since, to the best of my knowledge, taking the Covid-19 vaccine will save more lives (and lunges) than any damage side effects will cause.
Maybe I'm wrong, but since every health agency on earth seem to recommend taking it I can't imagine myself being wrong.
