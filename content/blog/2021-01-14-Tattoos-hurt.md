That tattoos hurt is perhaps no surprise to you, and it wasn't to me either.
But I had no idea what I was getting myself into.
You see, this past half-year I've had a sleeve done on my left arm and if I had known I'm not sure I would have gone through with it.
That does not mean that I regret it.
In fact I do not.
But it does mean I'm a bit of a wimp.

And why shouldn't I be wimp?
It fucking hurts.
"But frank", you might ask, "how come you don't regret it then?"
Well that is simple - its over.
"No pain, no gain" as you might see written across chest some jacked up dude.
Ignorance is a pretty damn good way to get yourself through something that, if you would have known, never would have subject yourself to.
And this principle is far wider then just tattooing.
Getting my master's degree in computer science has also been a long and arduous journey but there is only 6 months left, I'll be damned if I don't succeed now.

Often the anticipation of struggle, of pain, is worse then the actual thing. 
So if I can't have anesthesia at least bless me with ignorance.
