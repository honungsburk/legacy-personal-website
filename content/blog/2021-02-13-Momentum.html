  <p>When you do something that takes a lot of effort one has to have momentum. Because when you loose it, it is really hard to get the ball back rolling again. I’ve numerous dead git repos where I tinkered but never got a working prototype loosing all interest when progress grinded to a halt. And this is true for more things then just code. I’ve tried writing short stories and posed the exact same problem: I just couldn’t finnish them before getting bored.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That is why you have to have momentum. It is only protection against boredom. A few years ago I started painting and since then I’ve managed to get much better then I ever thought I would. Painting portraits was a long time goal of mine and it happened way sooner then I ever thought. And what made it happen was that I had a rigid schedule, and wasn’t discouraged when I made <a href="./2021-01-06-Progress.html">bad paintings</a>. Without which I’d never seen this level of progress.</p>
<p>But currently I’ve been struggling - not with the painting, that is trucking along - but a web app I’ve been hacking on. Three months ago I decided that writing an app that makes it easier for my dad to manage the sport equipments for the local handball club would be a good idea. Initially I heavily underestimated the amount of work that I needed do. The goal was to have a (shitty) working prototype by the start of february, which I of course blew right past. At this point I’d be happy if I can launch it sometime in march. And I’ve really felt down when problems that felt like I should be able to bang out in a day or two takes a week in reality. I have been loosing the momentum fast. Thinking if this really was such a good idea after all. So I decided to write this post and play a trick on myself by making a promise: I’m only allowed to stop working on it after my first release. If it sucks. If I don’t want to work on it any more that is fine. I’d never have to touch it again.</p>
<p>The trick is that the momentum you pick up from releasing something will pull you with it. And it won’t let go.</p>
