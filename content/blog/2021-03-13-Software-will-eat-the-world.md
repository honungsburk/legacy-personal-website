I'll make this short. 
For the past few months I've been reading up on the world of crypto.
I'm talking  blockchain, DID:s, trust of IP, crypto currencies, smart contracts, IPFS - the whole shebang.
There are a lot of get rich quick schemes, pumps & dumps and the like but if step away from that there is a deep ideological motivation behind the movement.
The idea that a lot of the government and other large forms of institutions can be improved, even replaced.
That they can be more democratic. 
More fair.
Guaranteeing every citizen on earth the inalienable rights of freedom of expression and commerce (and maybe even more).  

<!--more-->

Systems are being built that will improve the interoperability and convenience between all sorts of software systems and institutions behind them.
With DID:s each person has control over their own identity on which states can issue passports, doctors can hand out prescriptions, and schools give out diplomas.
With digital currencies overtaking fiat currencies no one, person or institution, will be able to be denied access to the financial system.
We perhaps might even be able to wrestle the control over our social lives out of the hands of the facebook and other social media giants.
There is a potential, a promise, that if realized will radically change how the world works.
We are talking about "the dismantling of the nation state" kind of change.
Of course, it it will come to pass is to early to tell, but the fact that the possibility even exists is insane.

The future is decentralized.
