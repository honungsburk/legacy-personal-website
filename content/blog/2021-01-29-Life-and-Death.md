Death is very simple, very clear, it happens at a particular point in time. 
A doctor could declare the time of death "to be between the hours of half past ten and eleven",
a vital clue as our dashing hero uncovers the murderer.

But when it comes to the opposite of death - to life.
Then time become significantly more tricky do discuss (and far more heated).
Your time of birth is when you made your grand debut outside your mothers body, but you were clearly alive well before that point.
Cutting you out in a c-section does not depend on the hour now does it?

No, life clearly started earlier.
Some claim that it happens at contraception.
Funny I would think, since a sperm clearly is alive and so is the egg of the mother.
And if two things that already are alive fuse together then that looks, at least to me, more like a continuation then a beginning.
I know that I'm slightly misrepresenting their view point. 
When someone says that "life begins at contraception" they probably mean something more akin to "a distinct human, with the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit happiness begins at contraception".
But again, that is me putting words in their mouth maybe that is not what they are trying to say at all?
What are they trying to say?

Unlike death human life has no fixed point when it begins.
It is gradual.
A fetus grows into a human bit by bit, more and more.
And life itself began ages ago. 
Billions of years ago.
