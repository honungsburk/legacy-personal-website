  <p>No matter where you turn there is a cry for objectivity. To analyse and report on some subject in neutral way which accurately portraits the different opinions, counter opinions, and of course counter counter opinions. I’ve myself searched far and wide, enjoying detailed documentaries, podcasts and books; Watched reviews, and read articles; Once I even delved in to the depths of a comment section, thankfully reemerged whole. But no - the best I’ve ever have come across was nuanced, not objective.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>If we take the word objective as meaning “truth independent from individual subjectivity” we stumble upon a problem. How exactly would you ever get rid of the subjectivity? Well, we interview a lot of different people with different opinions about some subject and … Sure, that sound about as good of an objective retelling of a collection of individual opinions, a workable approximation perhaps. But there are more ways to distort then to outright lie. Simply the choice of topic is powerful enough, no matter how objective the individual reportings on each subject is. The news might accurately and fairly write about the murders of a city or town. But if violent crime always makes the headlines then, as we know, it will make us think that it is more common then it really is.</p>
<p>If you really want to hammer it home I recommend watching old movies or documentaries. They say and believe things that we now would find outrageous, so there is a aspect of time to objectivity as well. It turns out that measuring skulls is racist.</p>
<p>Let me propose a solution. For a long time as was an avid watcher of the youtuber TotalBiscuit (<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/totalbiscuit-dead-john-bain-dies-youtube-star-vlogger-gamer-a8368586.html">who sadly passed away</a>). He reviewed video games and was always very clear about his own biases, his likes and dislikes. He pointed out the subjectivity in his reviews rather then trying to be objective. Sometimes he simply said that he didn’t like the genre but thought he give it a go since the game got so much media attention.</p>
<p>The quest for objectivity can become a sort of battleground of who’s views are canon. What I want is not one shared reality that every person on earth agrees on. Instead I seek the ability to know the reality in which the person I’m listening to thinks they inhabit.</p>
