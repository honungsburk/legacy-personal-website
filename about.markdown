Hi!
My name is Frank Hampus Weslien, if you hadn't alrady guessed that.
I was born in 1996, and spent my early days in Uppsala, Sweden before moving to Lund in 2016 to pursue a degree in software engineering at LTH.
On my spare time I like to write, paint and program, and every now and again I write a blog post.
