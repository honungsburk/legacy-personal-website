    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my second year of university I decided I needed a new hobby. I’d tried writing but the times I could sit down and get into the flow were few and far in between. You probably know the feeling. Your past self (always that damn past self) has promised you’ll do something but when you get to it you find out your not that stoked anymore (and he can go screw himself). But you sit down, maybe in front of your computer but better would be if you’d just grab a piece of paper. Where did I put the paper again? Anyway, if you’re lucky, you get on with it. But I wasn’t getting lucky often so on whim I started painting. No particular goal in mind but I thought to myself: “man, wouldn’t it be cool if I ever do a portrait?” And you know what? I liked.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Of course, the number of times I’ve been bored out of my mind while forcing myself to sit down and paint are more then I can count - but so are the times when I’ve forgotten what time it is. And little by little you start to get better. Not much. The progress day to day, week to week is so small… yet the progress from month to month, year to year is astounding.</p>
<p>Another thing is just how warped sense I had, and others still have, of what progress looks like. The absolute majority of all painting/drawing/sketching I do is remarkably unimpressive. There is a lot of throw away garbage you have to make before you ever get any better, and most surprisingly - the better you get the more throwaway paintings you need. Just as a runner need to run more miles, and the lifter put on another plate. As soon as what you do becomes easy you stop progressing.</p>
<p>To combat this collective narcissism that I’ll do something I’ve never done before - post one of my practice paintings.</p>

<p>I don’t know how much time I spent on it, lets say 40 minutes, a quick painting that was never meant to be seen. And even though it looks really bad I’ve found making them invaluable.</p>]]></summary>

and flee this castle and its stolen tract.<br />
Be borne on the wind to ever higher height.</p>
<p>Among hot sheets of silk lies our fight.<br />
The aftermath of bloody Mars’ loving act.<br />
Fall from your throne, your dying seat of might.</p>
<p>May what sprung prove worthy above all right,<br />
A bastard demi-god who’ll have the world sacked;<br />
Be borne on the wind to ever higher height.</p>
<p>Conquering each other’s fears in the sacred rite.<br />
White stone beaten soft, beautifully cracked.<br />
Fall from your throne, your dying seat of might.</p>
<p>Brave the violent seas and tumble by its smite,<br />
Lick the warm salt, embrace your loving pact;<br />
be borne on the wind to ever higher height.</p>
<p>Fear a dove’s loving lie, its shroud of white.<br />
Wash ashore, soaked in blisters, still intact.<br />
Fall from your throne, your dying seat of might;<br />
be borne on the wind to ever higher height.</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A full moon knocked on heaven’s door,<br />
where a slender body boiled in water,<br />
pulled to be spread on the marble floor,<br />
fair skinned, earth’s most cherished daughter.<br />
His eyes were blank, there was nothing but white.<br />
A lump hot steaming mess fixed in agony,<br />
one of the great-great souls brought back to sight,<br />
a half-hearted retort to life’s supposed monogamy.</p>
<p>“One of those days, just one of those days”<br />
as foreign carriages approached the castle<br />
where colored dots and swarms of gray<br />
spilled out to view their conquered vassal.<br />
They were greeted by a royal smile,<br />
but favored instead the crimson red,<br />
muttering for the miracle child,<br />
exclaiming, “where—where is it?”</p>
<p>Bathed in salt as if formed in ocean,<br />
on top a shell to be draped by Spring,<br />
the eternal lover’s favorite motion<br />
with copper hair curled just like the wind.<br />
The theater was laid in silverlight,<br />
and a purple haze embraced the crowd,<br />
roaring at the hint of a shadow of a sign.<br />
The rich mood dampened as the wind began to howl.</p>
<p>A stir in the clouds — an acid rain<br />
a giant’s fist’s shattering sound<br />
— a pinch of pain — trembling in awe<br />
edged to the brim — boiling in rage<br />
that’s when she threw himself on stage.</p>
<p>It’s here! It lives, it moves us!<br />
It behooves us! To take it where it groves us!<br />
My pencil, pen and rockstar muse…<br />
So obtuse, it fades — (barely used)</p>
<p>Do not ring my door; this is not my home.<br />
All parties must part their ways,<br />
and I drink my crimson red alone</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The spell was broken, the castle about to fall<br />
under the sun’s thousand-year-old pressure<br />
on the crimson cloaks to tear down its walls<br />
and leave the king with his only treasure.<br />
To catch him naked and then undress him,<br />
stuttering his answers to their every whim.</p>
<p>The first to fall was the gaudy chandelier,<br />
a centerpiece that stole too much attention,<br />
a display of wealth to detract from the austere<br />
condition that its shadow would never mention.<br />
And as his brilliant candles hit the floor,<br />
it cracked so deep its shadow lept from the wall.</p>
<p>He knew that future men would one day say<br />
that the crack was where it all began<br />
and never hail the sun that gave away<br />
its rays to shine on the burgeoning mountain<br />
built from the rubble of this abandoned castle,<br />
solid, with no halls to hide in.</p>
<p>Do you think of the dark side of the moon?<br />
Or the light that never kisses a body?<br />
Believing the two immortals know of bliss<br />
where all pain is shared with one another?<br />
Fear not, however close we are miles apart,<br />
two cosmonauts who just happened to cross paths.</p>]]></summary>

    <title>Ode to a Princess</title>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Princess, from which spring did you sprung?<br />
Yesteryear, like a flood down rolling mountains,<br />
or tomorrow bursting from a soaking tongue.<br />
You, the most oozing of youthful fountains,<br />
the prized picture in my crystal ball.<br />
Favorite niece, sweet child of mine,<br />
my youth, my home, my love, my crown!<br />
Stranger, a mist that twirls and twines,<br />
a comfortable fog who you dare not call<br />
a cloud of mind to the wonder of it all.<br />
Beloved subject, one day I’ll turn you down!</p>
<p>For I am nostalgic for the days of yore,<br />
the days when you weren’t fixed in form.<br />
In our breath, our thought, but wasn’t sure,<br />
but a distant haze, a buzzing swarm.<br />
Who came and laid the greens in a fiery show;<br />
fireflies — millions upon millions more<br />
flickering under the sun and its mistress<br />
kissing — the land blushing, shocked sore —<br />
with the red cloaks singing even though<br />
their desire is mired in the golden glow<br />
of hellfire, hellfire, heaven’s light, and hellfire.</p>
<p>Brave knight, you can not save what burned to ash;<br />
the fierce flames send shivers down your spine,<br />
a tingle, a sensation so subtle until it clash<br />
and wreaks havoc under the guise of “I feel fine”.<br />
The raging emptiness you hold inside,<br />
will it seep into a new idea, a brilliant phrase?<br />
Set things straight that didn’t need to be aligned.<br />
A curiosity exploring a warrior’s heart, a lunar phase,<br />
the white colossus of the sky that pulls the tide,<br />
in and out, day and night, the sun’s destined bride.<br />
To think that the great eight once were nine.</p>]]></summary>

that shifts and moves in see-through pinks and blues.<br />
The wonders of cosmos soon lost by the shore<br />
of oblivion, stronger than any other brew,<br />
longer lasting, the most mellow of the hues.<br />
As colored dots and swarms of grey arrive,<br />
I greet them with jokes while showing off the view.<br />
I wish I could just die; I wish I was alive.</p>
<p>Later, thinking about the doomsday-four,<br />
the quartet to orchestrate the coup<br />
on human life with all its joy and chore,<br />
and sing it out on a bittersweet adieu!<br />
That twists one’s heart as if it caught the flu.<br />
Like that stray comment that hit me in the side,<br />
and poured me on the rocks starving for advice.<br />
I wish I could just die; I wish I was alive.</p>
<p>Don’t you hear the cosmic dancers rave and play?<br />
The legends bombard every inch of floor.<br />
Can’t you feel the shock on every single day<br />
as they tap their feet chanting: “Nevermore!”<br />
Don’t you feel it slip — déjà vu, déjà vu —<br />
I write a rave review, a four out of five,<br />
and forget I ever uttered death’s sweet woo:<br />
I wish I could just die; I wish I was alive.</p>
<p>But then that eerie feeling strikes and undo<br />
all worldly joys and treats that give us drive,<br />
and for a moment only otherworldly do:<br />
I wish I could just die; I wish I was alive.</p>]]></summary>
